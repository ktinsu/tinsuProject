Slackware Linux is one of the oldest and most stable GNU/Linux distributions. This documentation involved installing Slackware inside a virtual machine step by step, manually setting up the environment, and performing basic configurations such as networking and also problems faced during installation. I hope these obstacles provided valuable learning experiences for beginners.
