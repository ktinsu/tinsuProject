# A.	Installation steps
Slackware Linux is one of the oldest and most stable GNU/Linux distributions. This documentation involved installing Slackware inside a virtual machine step by step, manually setting up the environment, and performing basic configurations such as networking and also problems faced during installation. I hope these obstacles provided valuable learning experiences for beginners.

# B. system call implementation
This part explains about  system call and implementation of clock_gettime()system call in slackware Linux, which retrieves the current time with nanosecond precision. In a C program, clock_gettime() is used to demonstrate how user programs can interact directly with kernel-level timing functions.
